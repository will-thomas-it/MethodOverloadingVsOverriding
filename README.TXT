We have a base class Burger with a display method.
We create a subclass Cheeseburger that extends Burger and overrides the display method to provide a different implementation.

We have a class BurgerOverload with two serve methods that demonstrate method overloading. 
The first method has no arguments, while the second method has a topping argument.

By running this code, you can see how method overriding (in Cheeseburger) allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method from the base class, 
while method overloading (in BurgerOverload) allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
